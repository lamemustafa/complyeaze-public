# Route Migration Ledger

This ledger tracks public route families before any private-app cleanup. A route
family is not ready for removal or redirect in the private ComplyEaze app until
its destination, evidence, cleanup rule, and rollback path are recorded here and
on the rendered `/migration/` page.

Family-level entries do not authorize cleanup by themselves. Each source route
being removed or redirected needs its own source host, source route, destination
host, destination route, hosted route 200, canonical, sitemap, redirect, cleanup
PR, and rollback evidence.

Host-aware rows are intentional: Pack and Tools routes are root-relative on their
own hosts, not `/pack/*` or `/tools/*` paths on `complyeaze.com`.

## Root public pages

- Source: Root public URLs on complyeaze.com: /, /resources/about-us, /resources/contact-us, /resources/privacy-policy, and /resources/terms-and-conditions
- Destination: complyeaze-public routes on complyeaze.com: /, /about/, /contact/, /trust/, /docs/, /migration/, /privacy/, /terms/, /status/, /changelog/, and /release-evidence/
- Status: root resource, trust/docs/migration, and policy/status/release pages seeded; cleanup blocked
- Cleanup rule: Do not remove parent routes until production host routing, canonical URLs, rollback redirects, and scripts/check-hosted-routes.mjs evidence are recorded.
- Parent cleanup: blocked; requires separate private-app cleanup PR after hosted and redirect evidence
- Evidence: Seed intent recorded. Hosted route, visual artifact, redirect, and private-app cleanup PR evidence are pending.
- Rollback: Keep parent routes available until the public static deploy serves matching routes and metadata, with hosted route evidence attached.

## Axal marketing

- Source: Axal public marketing URLs on axal.complyeaze.com: / and /<slug>
- Destination: complyeaze-public typed preview parity in apps/axal for / plus five /<slug> static public pages on axal.complyeaze.com; hosting and path routing remain pending
- Status: apps/axal typed preview parity for six same-host routes; hosting and cutover pending; cleanup blocked
- Cleanup rule: Do not move login, signup, reset, callback, or workspace flows into this repository.
- Parent cleanup: blocked; requires separate private-app cleanup PR after hosted and path-routing evidence
- Evidence: Typed preview parity is implemented in apps/axal from the canonical manifest; hosted route, path-routing, and private-app cleanup PR evidence are pending.
- Rollback: Preserve private-app path routing until Axal-hosted marketing routes and crawler metadata pass hosted route checks; restore private-app routing if cutover fails.
